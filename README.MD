### Project Title
Building Neural Network from Scratch to Predict Bike Rental Ridership in Bikeshare System in Washington D.C

### Project Description
In this project, I have built a neural network from the scratch to predict daily bike rental ridership. 

### Files used
Bike-Sharing-Dataset/hour.csv <Br>

### Code
The code for neural network is implemented in the `NeuralNetwork` class in `neural_network.py`. Network training and testing is done in `bikeshare_ridership_prediction.ipynb`.
